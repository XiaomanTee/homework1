-An empty street, an empty house
-A hole inside my heart
-I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller
-I wonder how, I wonder why
-I wonder where they are
-The days we had, the songs we sang together
-Oh, yeah
-And oh, my love
-I'm holding on forever
-Reaching for the love that seems so far
-So, I say a little prayer
-And hope my dreams will take me there
-Where the skies are blue
-To see you once again, my love
-Overseas, from coast to coast
-To find a place I love the most
-Where the fields are green
-To see you once again
-My love
-I try to read, I go to work
-I'm laughing with my friends
-But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking, oh no
